1.Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using
setTimeout? 

-The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is setImmediate() will always be
 executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle, independently of how many timers are present.


2.Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
 - setImmediate schedules a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events'
callbacks.
-process.nextTick is not part of the event loop, it adds the callback into the
nextTick queue. 

-Use setImmediate if you want to queue the function behind whatever I/O 
event callbacks that are already in the event queue. Use process
 nextTick to effectively queue the function at the head of the event queue so
 that it executes immediately after the current function completes
